PEAR::SVN Test Framework
------------------------

This is a test framework for SVN built using PHPUnit. 


Usage
------------------------
In order for any of these tests to work, they need to access a 
Subversion repository.

To set up the tests:

- Requires PHPUnit

- Requires SVN to be installed in a php include path, or the 
  tests need to be moved into the SVN root path.
  
- Hit test.php with a browser for the results, and get to work
  fixing bugs!

  
Writing tests
------------------------
The tests are all written using PHPUnit from pear, so first make
sure you have the latest stable release of PHPUnit, and have read
the PHPUnit docs at:
http://pear.php.net/manual/en/package.php.phpunit.php
